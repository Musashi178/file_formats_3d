## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add file_formats_3d to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:file_formats_3d, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure file_formats_3d is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:file_formats_3d]]
        end
